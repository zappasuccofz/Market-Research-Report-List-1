<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scrubber System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OpenLoopScrubbers</li><li>ClosedLoopScrubbers</li><li>HybridScrubbers</li><li>DryScrubbers</li><li>MembraneScrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The scrubber system market comprises several types, each designed to reduce emissions from vessels. Open-loop scrubbers use seawater to neutralize sulfur oxides, discharging the treated water back into the ocean. Closed-loop scrubbers recycle water mixed with alkaline agents, thus preventing environmental discharge. Hybrid scrubbers can switch between open and closed-loop operations. Dry scrubbers utilize solid materials to absorb pollutants, while membrane scrubbers employ selective membranes to filter out harmful gases, enhancing compliance with emission regulations.</p></p>
