<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Morphogenetic Proteins 7 Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sponge</li><li>Gel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMP) 7 market features two primary types: sponge and gel. Sponge BMPs are typically three-dimensional matrices that facilitate the delivery of growth factors and promote bone regeneration. They provide structural support and a scaffold for cellular attachment. On the other hand, gel BMPs offer a more fluid medium, enhancing the distribution of BMPs and providing a conducive environment for cell migration and proliferation. Both types play crucial roles in orthopedic and dental applications, fostering effective tissue healing.</p></p>
